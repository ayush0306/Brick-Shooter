The game is called "Fall of the Berlin Wall".

In the game , three types of bricks fall from the top of the window with a speed that is controllable by the user. The scoring is done accordingly.

The three types of bricks are red,green,black. The game consists of tow baskets, green and red, that collect the falling bricks. The game ends if a black brick falls into one of the basket.

The points scored are :-

	+10*100*fallRate -> if brick falls into basket of own colour
	+20*100*fallRate -> if shoot black brick
	-10*100*fallRate -> if shoot green/red brick

One can also change the position of the cannon and also its angle before shooting lasers. Also, after a laser beam is hsot it takes 1 second to recharge that.

I have also provided mouse controls. If you click somewhere nearby a bucket or cannon, you select that object and can them move them in their constrained path.
